# Interactive Architecture Diagram Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool for exploring and understanding system architecture diagrams through dynamic sequences and component interactions.

## Overview

This project provides an interactive way to visualize and explore system architecture diagrams. It uses p5.js for rendering and allows users to step through system interactions, making it an excellent tool for understanding complex system designs and architectural patterns.

## Features

- Interactive sequence visualization
- Step-by-step walkthrough of system interactions
- Multiple sequence navigation
- Message schema visualization
- Component interaction exploration
- PlantUML parsing support
- Visual feedback system

## Usage

### Navigation Controls

- **Spacebar**: Advance through the sequence step by step
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between different sequences
- **'S' Key**: View message schemas between components

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. The visualization will start automatically

## Technical Stack

- p5.js for visualization
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript for interaction handling

## Notes

This tool is designed to help with:
- System Design exploration
- Visual System Specification and Verification
- Understanding complex system interactions
- Interactive learning of architectural patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Click-through component exploration
- Deterministic choice operators
- Dynamic element creation and destruction
- Automatic layout with drag-and-drop state preservation
- Compare mode for interaction verification
- State management improvements
